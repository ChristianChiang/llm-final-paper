24,"In ""The Potts model and the Tutte Polynomial"", D.J.A. Welsh and C. Merino claim on pg. 1135, equation 18, that,\begin{align*}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f_i t^i = t^{n-1}T_G(1+\frac{1}{t},1)\end{align*}where $T_G(x,y)$ is the Tutte polynomial of some graph $G$ and $f_i$ denotes the number of forests of $G$ with exactly $i$ edges. Their paper is available online here . Welsh and Merino do not give any citations or proof for this claim. Does anyone know of such a proof? Also, is there a more explicit formula for $f_i$ in terms of $T_G(x,y)$? EDIT: I noticed recently that something must be wrong with the claimed formula because if $G$ is the disjoint union of $n$ isolated vertices, then $T_G(x,y) = 1$, so the righthand side becomes $t^{n-1}$; however the lefthand side is $1$.

26,"Let's say I have the following code which update a field of a struct using reflection.  Since the struct instance is copied into the DynamicUpdate method, it needs to be boxed to an object before being passed . struct Person{    public int id;}class Test{    static void Main()    {        object person = RuntimeHelpers.GetObjectValue(new Person());        DynamicUpdate(person);        Console.WriteLine(((Person)person).id); // print 10    }    private static void DynamicUpdate(object o)    {        FieldInfo field = typeof(Person).GetField(""id"");        field.SetValue(o, 10);    }} The code works fine.  Now, let's say I don't want to use reflection because it's slow.  Instead, I want to generate some CIL directly modifying the id field and convert that CIL into a reusable delegate (say, using Dynamic Method feature).  Specially, I want to replace the above code with s/t like this: static void Main(){    var action = CreateSetIdDelegate(typeof(Person));    object person = RuntimeHelpers.GetObjectValue(new Person());    action(person, 10);    Console.WriteLine(((Person)person).id); // print 10}private static Action<object, object> CreateSetIdDelegate(Type t){    // build dynamic method and return delegate} My question: is there any way to implement CreateSetIdDelegate excepts from using one of the following techniques? Generate CIL that invoke the setter using reflection (as the 1st code segment in this post).  This makes no sense, given the requirement is to get rid of reflection, but it's a possible implementation so I just mention. Instead of using Action<object, object> , use a custom delegate whose signature is public delegate void Setter(ref object target, object value) . Instead of using Action<object, object> , use Action<object[], object> with the 1st element of the array being the target object. The reason I don't like 2 & 3 is because I don't want to have different delegates for the setter of object and setter of struct (as well as not wanting to make the set-object-field delegate more complicated than necessary, e.g. Action<object, object> ).  I reckon that the implementation of CreateSetIdDelegate would generate different CIL depending whether the target type is struct or object, but I want it to return the same delegate offering the same API to user.",26,"EDIT again : This works structs now.
